   This is done under the assumption that in the most probable case, if a user wanted to view live reports on a
   specific coin on day "X", then he will also want to track the same coin again on the day he returns to the site.
2. Users can save up to 5 cryptocurrencies to a report list.
3. Users can view real-time prices of cryptocurrencies.
4. Users can search for their favorite cryptocurrencies.
5. Users can manage (add/remove) their favorite cryptocurrencies (report list).
